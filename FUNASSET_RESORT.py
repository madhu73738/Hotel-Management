           TOURIST DEPARTMENT

    From England and France to Italy and Germany, European countries are full of vibrant cities known for their museums,restaurants,nightlife and architecture.So,it comes as no suprise that deciding which spots are the best places to visit in Europe can be difficult.
    That's why Funassets considered the highlights of each destination-as well as user votes and expert opinions-to round up the best vacation destinations in Europe.Check the list given below:
        
     1.PARIS: Paris is filled with highly regarded museums,monuments and churches. You could easily spend your entire vacation admiring iconic sights like the Eiffel Tower,wandering through exhibits at the Louvre and strolling through the beautiful green space admiring flowers at Luxembourg Gardens.Still,you should save some time for people watching and munching on fresh croissants at sidewalk cafes during the day. Once the sun sets,sit down for a decadent French meal with amazing wine

     2.ROME: Rome is a can't-miss spot on your trip of Europe. The aroma of fresh Italian cooking wafts through the alleys, and historical sites stand proudly at every turn. No visit to Italy's capital woulb be complete without checking out the Colosseum,St.Peter's Basillica, the Sistine Chapel and the aweinspiring Trevi Foundation. If you have additional time, venture beyond the main sights to the Roman Forum, Trastevere and the Spanish Steps.

     3.LONDON: Exploring the world-class British Museum,seeing a musical in the West End,touring the Tower of London at a local pub are all part of the London bucket list experience. However, London's high hotel prices can make budget travelers cringe. To save money, book your accommodations far in advance or consider Funasset tourism services for an memorable experience.

     4.AMSTERDAM: There's more to Amsterdam than its notorious "coffee shops" and Red Light District. Spend the day biking through the city's stylish streets before exploring noteworthy museums, such as the Anne Frank House. Plan a picnic in Vondelpark for lunch, or opt for a boat tour along the city's many canals when it's time to rest your feet.Friendly locals and affordable Funasset resort keep bringing travelers back,especially, during the warmer months.
